# Missing Features & Gap Analysis

## 1. Functional Gaps
*   **Search Function:** With 18 services and 8 locations, a search bar (CMD+K style) would be a "Pro" feature.
*   **Live Chat / WhatsApp Button:** B2B often happens on the go. A "Chat on WhatsApp" floating button increases conversion for urgent requests (e.g., "Notfallreinigung").
*   **Recruiting Page (`/karriere`):**
    *   *Why:* A cleaning company is only as good as its staff. Showing that you hire professionally builds trust with clients ("They treat their staff well -> staff treats my building well").
    *   *SEO:* "Reinigungsjob München" is high volume.

## 2. Content Gaps
*   **"Über Uns" / Team Page:**
    *   People buy from people. Show the founders, the fleet, the office.
    *   Story: "Founded in Landshut, grew to Bayern."
*   **Blog / Ratgeber:**
    *   *Why:* To rank for informational keywords like "Wie oft Büro reinigen?" or "Kosten Gebäudereinigung pro qm".
    *   *Strategy:* 1 article per month establishes topical authority.

## 3. Technical Gaps
*   **Sitemap.xml:** Needs to be dynamic.
*   **Robots.txt:** Needs to be configured.
*   **404 Page:** Custom 404 page that leads back to the funnel (currently likely default Next.js).
*   **Analytics:** Ensure conversion tracking (Google Ads / GA4 events) is set up for the form submission, not just page views.

## 4. Legal Gaps (Check with Lawyer)
*   **Impressum/Datenschutz:** Ensure these are bulletproof and easily accessible (Footer).
*   **Cookie Consent:** You have a banner, but does it actually block scripts (GA4) before consent? (Needs verification).
