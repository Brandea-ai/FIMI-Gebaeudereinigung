# Homepage Analysis (`app/page.tsx`)

## 1. First Impression (Hero Section)
*   **Current State:** "Gebäudereinigung in [City]" typing effect is strong for local relevance.
*   **Critique:** The background image is the most important psychological anchor. The previous generic image was weak.
*   **Optimization:** The new **21:9 Authentic AI Image** (Andreas & Maria) will be a game changer. It must convey "German Reliability" instantly.
*   **Copy Tweak:** "Ihr Gebäude verdient mehr als sauber" is a great hook.
    *   *Suggestion:* Add a sub-hook for immediate action: "Angebot in 60 Minuten." (Speed sells).

## 2. Trust & Authority (`TrustContainer`)
*   **Current State:** 4 columns with icons. Good structure.
*   **Critique:** Icons are generic.
*   **Optimization:**
    *   Replace generic icons with **micro-animations** (e.g., a clock that actually ticks to 2h).
    *   **ISO Standards:** Make the ISO 9001/14001 badge much more prominent. It's a B2B trust anchor.

## 3. Services Overview (`ServicesContainer`)
*   **Current State:** List of 3 main categories.
*   **Critique:** Too shallow. It links to pages that *don't exist yet*.
*   **Optimization:**
    *   This section must act as a **portal**.
    *   Add a "Grid of All Services" (small pills/icons) below the main 3 cards so users see the full scope (e.g., "Winterdienst", "Glasreinigung") immediately.

## 4. Regional Relevance (`RegionenContainer`)
*   **Current State:** Tabs for cities.
*   **Critique:** This is good for the homepage, but bad for SEO if it's the *only* place this content lives. Google might view it as "duplicate content" if the text is similar.
*   **Optimization:**
    *   Keep this container, but make the "Mehr erfahren" button link to the specific `/standorte/landshut` page.
    *   The text here should be a *summary*, while the dedicated page goes deep.

## 5. Process & Conversion (`ProcessContainer`)
*   **Current State:** 4 Steps.
*   **Critique:** "Kontakt" -> "Analyse" -> "Angebot" -> "Umsetzung". Standard.
*   **Optimization:**
    *   **Psychological Trigger:** Add a "Risk Reversal". e.g., "Probe-Reinigung möglich" or "Monatlich kündbar".
    *   **The "Contact Person" Image:** The planned image of "Andreas" holding a tablet is crucial here. It humanizes the anonymous process.

## 6. Technical & SEO Check
*   **H1 Tag:** `<h1>Gebäudereinigung in [City]</h1>` (Dynamic). Excellent.
*   **H2 Tags:** Well structured.
*   **Internal Linking:** Currently weak because destination pages are missing.
*   **Mobile Experience:** The "Sticky Sidebar" in `ServicesContainer` might be annoying on mobile. Ensure it stacks correctly (needs verification).

## 7. Missing Elements
*   **"Bekannt aus" / Logos:** Do you have press mentions or partner logos (e.g., IHK, Innung)? Add them.
*   **Video:** A 10-second background video in the Hero (instead of a static image) often increases conversion by 20-30% for service businesses.
